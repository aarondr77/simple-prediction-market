# simple-prediction-market

This is a simple prediction market where anybody can pose a question, writing a description of the question on a
public/private website. The question poser gives out the questionID that can be used to make a prediction on his/her
question.

When the question is closed, the average numerical answer is computed and those who guessed within plus or minus
one decile of the average are rewarded and can claim their rewards after one week, allowing individuals adequate amount
of time to check if they won. The remainder of any payment not earned, will be deemable by an address of the question poser's 
choice. Ideally this is a charity, but the question poser has full discretion.
